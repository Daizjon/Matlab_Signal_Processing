# Speaker Recognition – Audio Data Collection & Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on collecting and analyzing recorded audio samples for basic speaker recognition and signal visualization using MATLAB.

## Project Description
A total of 12 audio recordings were created:

- One set of recordings saying:  
  "ECE315 … Signals and Systems … I like this class"
- One set saying the speaker’s name
- One set saying a favorite quote

Each set was recorded at different speaking speeds and with different background conditions.

## Objectives
- Record multiple speech samples under varying conditions
- Load and process audio signals in MATLAB
- Visualize waveform characteristics
- Compare variations across recordings

## Files Included

- `plotwav2.m`  
  MATLAB script used to load audio files and generate waveform plots.

- `proj1.tar`  
  Archive containing all recorded audio files.

- `subplots.pdf`  
  Output visualization containing 4×3 waveform subplots of the recorded signals.

## Results
A 4 × 3 subplot grid was generated to display waveform comparisons across all audio samples.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Audio signal processing fundamentals
