# Signal Processing Foundations – MATLAB

This repository contains foundational signal processing projects implemented in MATLAB. The projects focus on continuous-time and discrete-time signal behavior, waveform generation, and introductory audio analysis techniques.

Each project demonstrates practical implementation of core signal processing concepts through structured visualization and analysis.



## Projects Included

### 1. Real and Complex Exponential Signal Analysis
Exploration of continuous-time and discrete-time exponential signals, including:
- Separation of real and imaginary components
- Discrete-time exponential growth and decay analysis
- Continuous vs discrete comparison using structured subplots



### 2. Tone Generation and Audio Signal Fundamentals
Programmatic generation of sinusoidal tones in MATLAB:
- 2 kHz tone generation
- Time vector construction
- Audio playback using MATLAB functions
- Code refinement and structure improvement



### 3. Speaker Recognition – Audio Data Collection & Visualization
Introductory audio signal workflow including:
- Multi-condition speech recording
- Waveform comparison
- Visualization across varying background and speaking conditions
- Structured data handling in MATLAB



## Technical Focus Areas

- Continuous-Time vs Discrete-Time Signals
- Complex Exponentials and Euler’s Identity
- Time-Domain Visualization
- MATLAB Plotting and Subplot Structuring
- Basic Audio Signal Processing
