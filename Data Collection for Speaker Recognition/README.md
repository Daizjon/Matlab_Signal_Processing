Each student is to record 12 audio files with one set of files saying “ECE315 ... Signals and Systems ... I like this class” at different speed with different background,
a second set of files saying your name at different speed with different background,
and a third set saying your favorite quote. The files need to be submitted through
Canvas. Following is the requirement for the files and how to name the files. Please
strictly follow the naming convention of the files.
• A recording of you saying “ECE315 .... Signals and Systems ... I like this
class” with a clean background and a normal speed. Please pause for a few
second wherever you see “...”. Name the file XX-1.wav, where XX stands
for your initials.
• A recording of you saying “ECE315 .... Signals and Systems ... I like this
class” with a clean background but a faster speed. Name the file XX-2.wav.
• A recording of you saying “ECE315 .... Signals and Systems ... I like this
class” with a noisy background (you can turn on radio to make some background noise or record it on a busy street) and a normal speed. Name the file
XX-3.wav.
• A recording of you saying “ECE315 .... Signals and Systems ... I like this
class” with a noisy background but a faster speed. Name the file XX-4.wav.
• A recording of you saying your name with a clean background and a normal
speed. Name the file XX-5.wav.
