shows how to generate a tone (i.e., a sinusoid) in
MATLAB and listen to it with the sound command. The frequency of the tone
is 2 kHz, and the duration is 5 secs and is saved in
a file called mytone.m and ran from the command line.

There's also a file called tone.m that is an improvement of mytone.m
