Plots the real part and imaginary part of the following signal: x(t) = e^(jπ/6)

Plot a graph with 2 × 2 subplots. Each subplot illustrates one of
the discrete-time (D-T) real exponentials x[n] = zn with z taking on four
different values, z = 2, z = 1/2, z = −2, z = −1/2 . Explore MATLAB
function stem for D-T signal plots.

Plots a graph with 5 × 2 subplots. The left column shows the C-T
signals and the right column shows the D-T signals, with each row plotting
the following signals, respectively.
